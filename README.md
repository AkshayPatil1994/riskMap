## How to use the utility

- Arrange the results of various wind directions .or. time results (either way its a risk over time/direction that is averaged) into different directories in serial `1`,`2`,`3`, so on ...
- Choose the right parameters in `flowProperties` and place this file in `constant`
- Make sure deltaT, startTime, endTime are set according to the way the results are arranged so each timestep is one snapshot
- Place the `windRose.dat` file in `constant` directory with the file contents such that the total number of snapshots are equal to the elements in the data file.
- Run `riskMap`
