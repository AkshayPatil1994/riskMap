This OpenFOAM utility computes a risk map using a non-dimensional velocity, alpha, and beta input parameters 


## How to compile?

- Copy the `riskMap` directory to `$HOME/OpenFOAM/<user>-<version>/applications/utilities/`. Replace `<user>` with your username and `<version>` with your version name.
- Compile the application by typing `wmake`

## How to use the utility

- Arrange the results of various wind directions .or. time results (either way its a risk over time/direction that is averaged) into different directories in serial `1`,`2`,`3`, so on ...
- Choose the right parameters in `flowProperties` and place this file in `constant`
- Make sure deltaT, startTime, endTime are set according to the way the results are arranged so each timestep is one snapshot
- Place the `windRose.dat` file in `constant` directory with the file contents such that the total number of snapshots are equal to the elements in the data file.
- Run `riskMap`

## A case for urban fluid dynamics applications

- This utility was mainly designed to compute the directional averages and risk when simulating steady-RANS with multiple wind-incidences. Consequently, this would need some sort of a data-reduction/averaging methodology, thus we wrote the riskMap utility.
- Say all your 3D snapshots are stored in a directory as `results/fields_5`, `results/fields_10`, and so on until `results/fields_360`, corresponding to the 3D snapshots at various wind incidence angles. 
- Now you can use `copyresults4riskmap.sh` to copy only the `U` and `k` parameters to time directories.
- Run the `riskMap` utility and the results will be stored in `endTime + deltaT` directory.
- Example, each directory will have its own binary risk map while the averaged risk ($\mathcal{P}_r$), wind-rose averaged velocity ($\overline{U}_a$) and TKE ($\overline{k}_a$) will be stored in a directory `365` when using an angular resolution of $\Delta \theta = 5^{\circ}$.
